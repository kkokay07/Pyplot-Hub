![histobox](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4fadd98-4131-4e4d-8c29-fd520633d235)
Ever felt like your box plots were lonely? Or your histograms needed a hug? Well, say hello to HistoBox - the tool that brings these two visualization besties together for the ultimate data presentation party! 🎉

## What's in the Box? (Pun intended! 📦)
HistoBox takes your boring columnar data and transforms it into a visually stunning hybrid of histograms and box plots. Each data column gets its own special section with:
- A histogram that shows how your data likes to hang out
- A box plot that tells you where the cool kids (median and quartiles) are
- Tiny dots that represent those data points that like to be different (outliers)

## Data Format: Keep it Simple!
Your data should look something like this (tab-separated, just like siblings in a minivan):
```
ABC     XYZ     DEF     GHI     JKL
0.00199696      0.00240496      0.0013926       0.00179879      0.00185959
0.00201308      0.00243263      0.00160217      0.00200041      0.00196152
0.00208676      0.00255315      0.00174561      0.00215292      0.00212449
0.00192432      0.00220958      0.00152361      0.00198425      0.00198323
```

## Ready to Rock? 🎸
1. Grab the `HistoBox.py` script (it's like a DJ for your data)
2. Use the example `input.txt` to practice (because practice makes perfect!)
3. Run it like this:
```bash
python HistoBox.py --input input.txt --title "My Awesome Data" --output cool_plot.png --dpi 600
```

And voilà! You get a beautiful visualization that's both informative AND stylish. It's like giving your data a makeover, but with actual statistical meaning!

Remember: Good visualization is like a good peanut - it has two complementary halves that work better together! 🥜
